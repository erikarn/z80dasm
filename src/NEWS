z80dasm 1.2.0
=============

	Added support for instructions specific to the Z180 microprocessor
	(thanks to Ben Hildred)

	Add --sym-comments option to transfer comments about symbols from the
	symbol file to the output (thanks to Michael Riviera)

	Improved the way output is aligned into columns. Add --tab-width and
	--tab-stops options.

z80dasm 1.1.6
=============

	Add --sym-order option to define the order of symbols written to the
	symbol file.

	Fix a segfault when a symbol file defined a symbol at the same address
	as a block start (e.g. when a symbol file initially created by z80dasm
	is re-used using --sym-input).

        Fix compatibility with C89 compilers (thanks to Al Petrofsky)

z80dasm 1.1.5
=============

	Added support for many undocumented instructions from the list at
	http://www.z80.info/z80undoc.htm, such as instructions involving IXL,
	and IXH registers.

	By default, all undocumented instructions are now disassembled as defbs
	with the instruction name in a comment due to missing or buggy support
	in z80asm. A new --undoc option has been added to change this behavior.

	Disassembly of "ED xx" instructions appearing at the end of input has
	been fixed.

z80dasm 1.1.4
=============

	Added options for unlabeled blocks and blocks that have a label at the
	last byte (instead of at one after the last byte)

	When a block was inserted in the middle of another block, the linked
	list of blocks got corrupted, which could lead to wrong disassembly in
	some cases.

z80dasm 1.1.3
=============

	Target addresses of relative branches weren't properly wrapped
	around the boundaries of 16-bit address space, resulting in missing
	labels for such branches and stack corruption due to a buffer
	overflow on 64-bit architectures.

	Thanks to Eric Smith for reporting this bug and providing a patch.

z80dasm 1.1.2
=============

	Added missing files to the tar file.

z80dasm 1.1.1
=============

	Fixed bug in label creation: a label was created for every 0xdd 
	command.

z80dasm 1.1.0
=============

	Rewritten symbol table routines. Support for input symbol files
	('-S' option). Removed unnecessary and badly documented '-r'
	option. Better comments in the output symbol file regarding where
	in the assembly source a particular symbol is used.

	Support for spliting binary file into data and code blocks.

	Automatic labels that are first seen in a "call" instruction are
	named "sub_XXXXh" instead of "lXXXXh".

z80dasm 1.0.1
=============

	Various Debian package related changes.

	Unprintable characters are replaced by ASCII dot when using '-t'
	option (similar to hexdump).

	Some minor bug fixes.

Summary of changes from dz80 3.0 to z80dasm 1.0.0
=================================================

dz80dat.c:
	Fixed table entry for "2c" opcode (inc l).

dz80.c:
	Added undocumented instruction "sli" ("cb 30") to the opcode decoding 
	logic.  

	Replaced command-line handling code with calls to code in cmdline.c.

	Made Zilog-assembler compatiblity mode run-time configurable.

	Fixed incorrect handling of sign bit for offsets for relative jumps
	("jr" and "djnz" instructions)

	Fixed handling of unknown or partial opcodes (these are now included
	in the output with "defb" assembler directives)

	New function for error reporting in cmdline.c

	Disassembler output from pass 1 and 2 redirected from standard output 
	to temporary files.
